    <p class="cl-blurb">
      During the coronavirus pandemic, the world's most vulnerable people have begun to starve. Unable to leave their homes to find work, day laborers are unable to work and thus unable to buy food. Our friends at Impact Nations have partners in Uganda, Kenya, the Philippines, and India who are able to meet this growing need in their communities. So far they have been able to provide over 750,000 meals! <a href="https://www.impactnations.com/product/358-COVID/covid-isaiah-58-feeding-response">You can learn more here</a>.

      Just like a relay race needs a team to compete, this hunger crisis needs a team of folks like you and me to come together to meet this need. Taking the baton means joining a team of people who give in order to feed the most vulnerable!
    </p>
    <h2 class="cl-fancy-subheading text-warning mt-5">How much of the money actually goes to food?</h2>
    <p class="cl-blurb">
      100%. You heard right. 100%! And it doesn’t matter if you give $1 or $100! There is no minimum amount to be part of the team!
    </p>

    <h2 class="cl-fancy-subheading text-warning mt-5">What if my son wants to give a nickel?</h2>
    <p class="cl-blurb">
      Great! There’s no amount too small! We also encourage any kids who want to give to do so via an adult. If you want to give an amount less than $5, please email us at <a href="mailto:contact@crazylovechurch.com">contact@crazylovechurch.com</a> and we can make it happen!
